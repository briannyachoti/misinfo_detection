## Misinformation and Deepfake Detection on Social Media
Recent advancements in the digital space have been marked by the rapid growth and development of AI. While AI plays a crucial role in the creation and distribution of information, its risks have raised concerns among stakeholders. For instance, misinformation and deepfake content dominate major social media platforms, increasing online hatred, damaging public trust and reputations, undermining transparency and accountability, and escalating security threats.
Although experts continue to devise new techniques to mitigate this issue, new and more sophisticated evasion tactics constantly emerge, making it challenging to maintain safe and secure social media platforms. This project aims to leverage machine learning concepts to develop an AI-driven system for detecting misinformation and deepfake content on social media.

# Primary Objectives:
* Build a robust misinformation and deepfake detection model to flag manipulated and misleading information.
* Improve detection capabilities using advanced deep learning techniques.
* Simulate cyberattacks to evaluate the effectiveness of different AI models and propose improvements based on the findings.
